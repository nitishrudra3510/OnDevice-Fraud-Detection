## üìã SCRIPT STRUCTURE

### **0:00 - 0:30 | INTRO & PROBLEM STATEMENT**
```
[SCREEN: Title slide with project name and team info]

"Hello everyone! I'm [Your Name] from [Your Team Name], and today I'm excited to present our solution for the Samsung AI Hackathon 2025.

Our project addresses a critical challenge in today's digital world: How can we detect fraudulent behavior on mobile devices while preserving user privacy and ensuring real-time performance?

We've built an On-Device Multi-Agent System for Behavior-Based Anomaly & Fraud Detection that runs entirely on your smartphone, protecting your data without sending it to the cloud."
```

### **0:30 - 1:30 | PROBLEM DEEP DIVE**
```
[SCREEN: Show real-world fraud examples - banking apps, mobile payments, etc.]

"Let me show you why this matters. Every day, millions of people use their phones for banking, payments, and sensitive transactions. Traditional fraud detection relies on cloud-based systems that:
- Require internet connectivity
- Have privacy concerns
- Introduce latency delays
- May miss real-time threats

Our solution eliminates these problems by bringing AI-powered fraud detection directly to your device. We use behavioral biometrics - the unique way you type, touch, move, and use apps - to create a personalized security profile that adapts to your behavior patterns."
```

### **1:30 - 2:30 | SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW**
```
[SCREEN: System architecture diagram - show the 4 agents feeding into decision fusion]

"Here's how our system works. We've designed a multi-agent architecture with four specialized AI agents, each monitoring a different aspect of user behavior:

üéØ **Typing Agent**: Analyzes your keystroke dynamics - how fast you type, the rhythm between keys, and typing patterns unique to you.

üëÜ **Gesture Agent**: Monitors touch and gesture patterns - pressure sensitivity, swipe speeds, and how you interact with your screen.

üì± **App Usage Agent**: Tracks your application behavior - which apps you use, when you use them, and your usage patterns.

üö∂ **Movement Agent**: Analyzes your mobility patterns - location changes, movement frequency, and travel behavior.

All four agents work together, feeding their analysis into a central decision fusion system that makes the final call on whether behavior is normal or suspicious."
```

### **2:30 - 4:00 | TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**
```
[SCREEN: Show code structure and model details]

"Let me walk you through our technical implementation. We've built this using cutting-edge technologies:

**Machine Learning Models:**
- One-Class SVM for typing patterns
- Isolation Forest for gesture analysis  
- Autoencoder neural network for app usage
- CNN/LSTM hybrid for movement patterns

**On-Device Optimization:**
- TensorFlow Lite conversion for mobile deployment
- Model quantization to reduce size by 75%
- Dynamic range optimization for performance
- Pure TFLite BUILTINS compatibility - no external dependencies

**Privacy-First Design:**
- All processing happens locally on your device
- No data leaves your phone
- Real-time analysis with sub-100ms latency
- Battery-optimized for continuous monitoring"
```

### **4:00 - 6:00 | LIVE DEMONSTRATION**
```
[SCREEN: Start the Streamlit app - ./run_simple_app.sh]

"Now, let me show you our system in action! I'm launching our interactive dashboard that demonstrates the multi-agent decision system.

[LAUNCH APP: http://localhost:8508]

Perfect! Here's our working dashboard. Notice the sidebar controls where I can adjust the importance of each agent:

- Typing Agent weight: 0.25
- Gesture Agent weight: 0.25  
- App Usage Agent weight: 0.25
- Movement Agent weight: 0.25

And here's our decision threshold slider, currently set at 0.6. This determines how sensitive our system is to suspicious behavior.

Now, let me run a simulation to show you how the agents work together. I'll click 'Run Simulation' and you'll see real-time results from our multi-agent fusion system.

[CLICK: Run Simulation button]

Excellent! Look at these results. Our system analyzed 100 behavior samples and classified them as normal or suspicious based on the combined input from all four agents.

The charts show:
- Individual agent scores over time
- Score distributions for each agent
- The fused decision threshold visualization

Notice how the system combines all four signals to make a final decision. This multi-modal approach is much more robust than relying on just one type of behavior analysis."
```

### **6:00 - 7:30 | KEY FEATURES & INNOVATIONS**
```
[SCREEN: Highlight key features and technical innovations]

"Let me highlight what makes our solution special:

**üîí Privacy-Preserving**: Everything runs on-device. Your behavioral data never leaves your phone, ensuring complete privacy.

**‚ö° Real-Time Performance**: Sub-100ms latency means instant fraud detection without waiting for cloud processing.

**üß† Adaptive Learning**: The system learns your normal behavior patterns and adapts over time, reducing false positives.

**üì± Mobile-Optimized**: Lightweight models that don't drain your battery while providing continuous protection.

**üîÑ Configurable Fusion**: Security teams can adjust agent weights and thresholds based on their specific use cases and risk tolerance.

**üåê Offline Capability**: Works without internet connectivity - perfect for areas with poor network coverage or when you want to ensure privacy."
```

### **7:30 - 8:30 | USE CASES & APPLICATIONS**
```
[SCREEN: Show different application scenarios]

"Our system has broad applications across multiple industries:

**üè¶ Banking & Finance**: Detect account takeover attempts, unusual transaction patterns, and fraudulent mobile banking activities.

**üí≥ Mobile Payments**: Identify suspicious payment behaviors, location anomalies, and device compromise.

**üè¢ Enterprise Security**: Protect corporate data on employee devices, detect insider threats, and ensure compliance.

**üì± Consumer Apps**: Secure social media accounts, email access, and personal data on mobile devices.

**üöó Transportation**: Detect unauthorized vehicle access, unusual driving patterns, and fleet security.

**üè• Healthcare**: Protect patient data on mobile devices, detect unauthorized access to medical records.

The beauty of our approach is that it's application-agnostic - the same behavioral biometrics framework can be adapted to any domain that needs user authentication and fraud detection."
```
